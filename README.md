# Brain Tumor Classfication Using Scikit-learn model

## Description

In this project, we used Python's scikit-learn package to classify the types of brain tumors. </br>
</br>
The types of brain tumors were classified into the following four categories. </br>
- glioma-tumor
- meningioma-tumor
- pituitary-tumor
- no-tumor
</br>
 
 and the datasets were given by professor Lee.
